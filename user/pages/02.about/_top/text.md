# About me

My name is Zabby Allen and I'm addicted to craft supplies. Do you have several drawers solely dedicated to ribbons or a collection of tin cans that you'll “use for a project one day”? Sounds like you're addicted too! 

I've created this blog to share some fun and colourful DIY projects that will hopefully help us creative folk tackle our overflowing collections of craft materials. I'll also be trying to expand my creativity by sharing easy recipes and free desktop wallpapers and other printables.

William Morris once said:
>“_Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful._” 

Unfortunately if you're anything like me you're likely to find a potential use for every bit of rubbish you find – so let's start creating and prove that everything is useful and can eventually be beautiful. Craft hoarders unite!
