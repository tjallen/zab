# About me

Hi, thanks for visiting! This blog started as a place to share DIY projects (and a good excuse to try and cut own my huge hoard of craft supplies), but recently itâ€™s grown into more of a creative journal to document my inspirations and aspirations, interview some of my favourite creatives, and share my thoughts. I still share the odd DIY project too as well as the occasional free download!
