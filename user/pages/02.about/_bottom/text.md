I am a 24 year old South London girl with a love for travel and the outdoors. I trained as a Book Artist & Designer at LCC, graduating in 2013. For my final major project I set up a little pop-up shop selling things I created from my ridiculous collection of craft supplies after reading a book about hoarding and seeing lots of hoarding tendencies in myself. Although the project really only encouraged me to buy more craft supplies (I think I might be beyond help!), I had a lot of fun doing it and was inspired to start this blog.

Now my work life is as varied as my collection of buttons: I work as a freelance designer, an illustrator's agent for [Phosphor Art](http://www.phosphorart.com/), help out start-up ice cream company [Drunken Dairy](http://drunkendairy.co.uk) (yes we DO make alcoholic ice cream!!) and am also a certified Girl Gang member at the super fun subscription box service [Lucky Dip Club](http://www.luckydipclub.com).

It sounds like a cliché but I have always been crafty. As a child I would decorate my doll's house with wallpaper samples I collected from our local hardware shop and rugs I made from fabric sample books. In my teenage years I very much enjoyed ripping up jeans and covering them in bleach or making pillow cases into skirts (Obviously I looked super cool!). So I thought it would be a good idea to create a place where I can share my crafty activities and hopefully clear some space in my house which currently resembles a branch of Hobbycraft after an earthquake. Please follow along, create, and connect with me!
