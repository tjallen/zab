My name is Zabby Allen and I'm addicted to craft supplies. Do you have several drawers solely dedicated to ribbons or a collection of tin cans that you'll “use for a project one day”? Sounds like you're addicted too! 

I've created this blog to share some fun and colourful DIY projects that will hopefully help us creative folk tackle our overflowing collections of craft materials. I'll also be trying to expand my creativity by sharing easy recipes and free desktop wallpapers and other printables.

William Morris once said:
>“_Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful._” 

Unfortunately if you're anything like me you're likely to find a potential use for every bit of rubbish you find – so let's start creating and prove that everything is useful and can eventually be beautiful. Craft hoarders unite!

I am a 24 year old South London girl with a love for travel and the outdoors. I trained as a Book Artist & Designer at LCC, graduating in 2013. For my final major project I set up a little pop-up shop selling things I created from my ridiculous collection of craft supplies after reading a book about hoarding and seeing lots of hoarding tendencies in myself. Although the project really only encouraged me to buy more craft supplies (I think I might be beyond help!), I had a lot of fun doing it and was inspired to start this blog.

Now my work life is as varied as my collection of buttons: I work as a freelance designer, an illustrator's agent for [Phosphor Art](http://www.phosphorart.com/), help out start-up ice cream company [Drunken Dairy](http://drunkendairy.co.uk) (yes we DO make alcoholic ice cream!!) and am also a certified Girl Gang member at the super fun subscription box service [Lucky Dip Club](http://www.luckydipclub.com).

It sounds like a cliché but I have always been crafty. As a child I would decorate my doll's house with wallpaper samples I collected from our local hardware shop and rugs I made from fabric sample books. In my teenage years I very much enjoyed ripping up jeans and covering them in bleach or making pillow cases into skirts (Obviously I looked super cool!). So I thought it would be a good idea to create a place where I can share my crafty activities and hopefully clear some space in my house which currently resembles a branch of Hobbycraft after an earthquake. Please follow along, create, and connect with me!
